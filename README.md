# Three-Fourths-Phase
The expression refers to how the three-fourths phase gate (also known as the 
P(3π/4) gate) can be decomposed into a product of two fundamental quantum gates: the 𝑇 gate and the 𝑆 gate.
𝑆 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\pi/2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{bmatrix}
